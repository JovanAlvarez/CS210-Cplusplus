# CS210-Cplusplus

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The goal of this project was to create a program capable of reading a TXT file, count all occurances of each variable, then have those variables accessible by a user from a basic interface. It can be used as a rudimentary inventory system with  an optional histogram count method if the user prefers that over an integer. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I feel as though the code I wrote for this project is neat and organized. Certainly not to professional standards, I am sure, but I am happy with my capabilities in maintaining an easily readable format. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Although I have made progress in this regard, I still need to improve in knowing where certain files should be located and stored in the source files to make my program more secure and accessible for other programmers/editors. I want to aim to make my code as user friendly as possible and if I can get a little bit better of an understanding on the standardized way files are organized within a repos, it can help me form better habits in the event another programmer needs to edit my code in the future. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I think the most difficult part of this project was writing the code for the "frequency" file, which was made to call from the header file and allowed the "Main" file to be simple and neat, as most of the complex code was within this file instead. Debugging this file was tricky and I did various searches online from other people trying to do something similiar and took advice from some more senior programmers on how to properly structure this file and work out the errors. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I believe this was the most extensive project I have done in C++ and I learned a ton from it. My skills in this language are still very novice but I am more confident now that I have completed a few projects. My skills in creating classes and implementing inheritance into my code has grown due to projects like this one and those are skills that will help with all languages and courses I go through in the future. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
As I was writing, I kept the rules of OOP in mind. As I mentioned above, inheritance was something I attempted to flex in this project, allowing my "Main" file to be as organized as possible. Encapsulation is another thing I made a conscious effort to maintain, differentiating between public and private methods. I am still not super confident in exactly which information and files should be located where in the repos but I still think my code was structured so that if something needs to be edited or manipulated, it should be easy to find and accomplish.
