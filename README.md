# CS210-Cplusplus

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The goal of this project was to create a program capable of reading a TXT file, count all occurances of each variable, then have those variables accessible by a user from a basic interface. It can be used as a rudimentary inventory system with  an optional histogram count method if the user prefers that over an integer. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I feel as though the code I wrote for this project is neat and organized. Certainly not to professional standards, I am sure, but I am happy with my capabilities in maintaining an easily readable format. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Although I have made progress in this regard, I still need to improve in knowing where certain files should be located and stored in the source files to make my program more secure and accessible for other programmers/editors. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
